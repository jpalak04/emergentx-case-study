# EmergentX – Bridging the Prompt Gap

A product case study built **on** Emergent, **for** Emergent.  
This project explores how onboarding can improve with better prompt scaffolding, clearer plugin recommendations, and real user insights.

## 🔍 About
EmergentX is a lightweight, embedded layer that helps users move from vague ideas → structured prompts → relevant plugin suggestions.  
This case study features stories from two real users (Aanshi, 12 and Riya, 23), comparing how new builders interact with AI tools like Emergent.

## 🧠 Highlights
- Real-world testing with creative and non-technical users
- Rebuilt from Notion into Emergent to test platform capabilities
- Visual proposal of the prompt-to-app journey
- Ideas for creators, commerce, and team workflows
- Involvement of vibe coders and the community


## 📁 Structure
- `frontend/` – React-based frontend UI
- `backend/` – Static backend shell (not active)
- `scripts/` – Build and deployment helpers

## 🤝 Connect

I'm open to chatting more about building for creative tools, onboarding systems, or Emergent itself.
