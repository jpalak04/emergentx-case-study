# Bridging the Prompt Gap – EmergentX Case Study

This is a product case study built inside Emergent, using Emergent, to reflect on its onboarding experience and prompt tooling.

It started as a Notion document, but I wanted to explore whether Emergent could tell its own story — not just build apps, but explain *why* those apps matter.

### What’s Inside
- A walkthrough of common prompt challenges faced by new users
- Real user stories (Aanshi, age 12 & Riya, a marketing student)
- A lightweight proposal: EmergentX – a native prompt assistant
- Insights into how guided prompting could unlock creative use cases
- Reflections on how this compares to tools like Cursor and Firebase Studio

### Built With
- Emergent platform (no custom backend)
- React frontend (auto-generated + custom prompt refinements)
- Tailwind CSS
- Hosted on Vercel

### Why This Exists
I wanted to test Emergent’s potential, to see if it could host a product idea, not just power it. This was an experiment in platform as pitch.
